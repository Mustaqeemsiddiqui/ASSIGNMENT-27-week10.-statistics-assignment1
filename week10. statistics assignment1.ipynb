However, the differences between the categories may not be uniformly measurable. Examples of ordinal data include ratings (poor, fair, good, excellent), educational levels (high school, bachelor's degree, master's degree), or survey responses (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree). In ordinal data, the order matters, but the magnitude of differences between categories may not be precise."

    "Measures of Variability:\n",
